[Resource Quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/), defined by a ResourceQuota object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per namespace. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a namespace by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources that may be consumed by resources in that namespace.
