A [role binding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#rolebinding-and-clusterrolebinding) grants role permissions to a user or set of users.It holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference to the role being granted. A **<i>RoleBinding</i>** grants permissions within a specific namespace whereas a **_ClusterRoleBinding_** grants that access cluster-wide.
