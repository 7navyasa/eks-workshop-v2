In Kubernetes, you must be <i>authenticated</i> (logged in) before your request can be <i>authorized</i> (granted permission to access).Kubernetes expects attributes that are common to REST API requests. This means that Kubernetes authorization works with existing organization-wide or cloud-provider-wide access control systems which may handle other APIs besides the Kubernetes API.
