Savings Plans offer discounts over On-Demand pricing and there are two types that apply to Amazon EKS workloads:  Compute Savings Plans and EC2 Instance Savings Plans.  Although both have unique attributes, both offer different discounts for a commitment of using a specified amount of compute power for either a one year or three year period.  Use the AWS Cost Explorer to view Savings Plans recommendations and to purchase them in your account.

There were no resources created during the completion of this module, and there is nothing to clean up.
